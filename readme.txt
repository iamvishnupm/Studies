I have deep questions about the traditional way of learning. I feel like traditional way of learning every basics and then going in to practicals seem to be very inefficient, I feel like it lacks something, I have been thinking about this a lot.

Finally it clicked me, the traditional methods are taking the fun away from learning because it doesn't involve researching. 

Everything humans learned and are through practical applications, repeated trials and errors, but traditional method focus too much on theory, I think going back to learning through trials and errors will make the journey way more interesting and effective.

I think the main factor here is the curiosity will drive us forward and results will reward us. I believe that is the way to learn everything faster.

Since I have been learning something in old ways till now, I decided to start over.

From now on I am going to learn everything through building things. this is a revolutionary experiment to see how good I can do if I start to learn stuff the new way I described. With the help of AI, I believe this will be a big success.

I have zero clue if this will work or not. but I believe this would be billion times better than the boring traditional method of learning.

This is just an experimental journey, let's see what happens.
